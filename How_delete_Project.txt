It's going to be toughest part.
Just follow my steps (at first read the whole instruction and then follow them):
  1. Open Task Manager in pc.
  2. Search for Hospital-Management-System in task manager, and select that row.
  3. Open My PC -> Documents -> Visual Studio 2012 -> Projects and Select Hospital-Management-System and press delete key. It will show a pop-up that file is in use and can't be deleted. Don't worry.
  4. Change tab, move to Task Manager. Now press " End Task " (keep in mind Hospital-Management-System should be seleced their).
  5. Now with in few seconds(as fast as you can) change tab to deleting error pop-up and hit " Try Again ". And My project is Succesfully deleted !!!
